Learning Tips 
=============

Intuitions
----------

Your intuitions are your best guide. Always try to understand, never be
bothered by not getting it. Keep your questions as pending. You don't need to
understand everything.

Practice & experiment
---------------------

Ideally try to program one hour a day.

Always experiment and try things out. You can only learn to program by doing.

Emotions
--------

Learning something like programming can be frustrating. 

Computers and humans are different; we excel at different things. 

Computers are utterly stupid, they are unforigivingly precise and logical. 
Humans can be logical but they also have intelligence, imagination, and creativity.

All programmers, beginners and advanced, make plenty of mistakes and often get stuck. 

Manage your expectations. Know that everyone has been through the same.
Computers are a tool waiting for you to learn to master them.

Everyone can learn to program
-----------------------------

Studies have shown the only difference between people who are good at
programming and those who aren't is almost completely related to amount of time spent programming.

Go very slow
------------

As humans we think at a higher intuitive level. We think square, or move
forward. 

Computers need everything broken down into steps. Each step is a command.

Programming as an activity is about breaking down our concepts into smaller defined steps.
In effect we define our concepts in commands.

Find a project
--------------

Although programming has plenty of intrinsic value its only as popular as it is
because of the things you can do with it.

Unfortunately we won't look into detail at the many application domains as we
don't have time. Use the resources section to choose an area that is of
interest and focus on it.
