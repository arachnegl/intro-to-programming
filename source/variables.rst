Variables - Nouns
*****************


Naming Objects 
==============

Variables name objects. They refer to an object.

Lets name some numbers::

    x = 5

Lets name some strings::

    name = "greg"


Variables in Python can refer to any type of objects::

    x = 5
    print(x)
    x = 'greg'
    print(x)

We can also use call functions with variables as arguments.

If you call print with the variable x ``print(x)``, you will output x's value.

With turtle::

    turtle.forward(x)


Exercises
=========

Many Squares with Variables
---------------------------

We will demonstrate the use of variables by revisiting the many squares exercise.

Replace the numbers with variables. 
We should have the following variables: ``rotate_angle``, ``side``, ``right_angle``

Do copy and paste!!

What are the benefits?

- Is the code more readable?

- Easier to update?
