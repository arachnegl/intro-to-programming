Calling Functions
*****************

Action objects
==============

Functions are another type of object. 

Think of them as actions, verbs, or commands.

They have names::

    run

They are called (actioned) by using parentheses::

    run()

Sometimes we call and pass parameters (here a number)::

    run("quickly")

Think of parameters as adverbs: 'run, quickly'

All the instructions you gave turtle are examples of calling functions.

Tip:

    Programming is always applied to something. Its an activity that seeks to
    capture some aspect of reality that is useful to us. 

    As humans we think at a higher intuitive level. We think square, or move
    forward. 

    Computers need everything broken down into steps. Each step is a command.

    Programming as an activity is about breaking down our concepts into smaller defined steps.
    In effect we define our concepts in commands.


Geometry Exercises
==================

Here we will program some geometrical concepts.

Lets define some of our gemetrical concepts using step by step instructions.

Draw a Square
-------------

Draw a square as in the following picture:

.. image:: /images/turtle-square.png

Squares have right angles which are 90 degrees.


Draw a rectangle
----------------

Draw a rectangle.

Bonus
-----

How about a triangle? In an equilateral triangle (a triangle with all
sides of equal length) each corner has an angle of 60 degrees.


Many squares
------------

Now, draw many squares. Each one tilted left of the previous. 
Experiment with the angles between the individual squares.

The picture shows three 20 degree turns. You could try 30 and 40...
