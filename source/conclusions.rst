Conclusions 
***********

Programming
===========

The constructs we have learnt (loops, conditions, data structures) mean that we
are far more expressive as programmers.

Combined with abstractions we can compose and recompose new programs.

Building on our previously defined concept of a house we now use repetition 
to define a row of houses.

:: 

    def row_of_houses(number, size):
        for i in range(number):
            house(size)
            turtle.forward(size)

This is how complex and useful programs are built.


Design
======

We have gone from step by step instructions to defining blocks of code in such
a way as to define higher level concepts.

Defining reusable components and the ability to repeat them is immensely powerful.

Think of everything you can make from Lego bricks. Minecraft is a world build
with cubes. In the real world think of all the components and repetition you
typically find in a skyscraper.

This is where programming starts to become creative. You can define the
universe of things that is of interest to you.


Exercises
=========

A Text editor
-------------

Think about the objects that you'd have to use to reprsent editing text.


Your Project
------------

Programmers model other domains. Think of an area where you are expert and
how you might code it.

What objects, functions and variables would need to be defined?
