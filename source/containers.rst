Data Structures
***************

Data structures or collections contain other objects. 

They are meant to keep a collection of objects together.

Python offers four main ones: `lists`, `dictionaries`, `tuples`, `sets`.

It takes some time and practie knowing when to use each.

Operations that interest us are accessing and updating elements of the structures.

A major use of collections is iteration. This means going through each of the
members of the 

Lists
=====

example::

    >>> pythons = ['John Cleese', 'Eric Idle', 'Michael Palin', 'Terry
    Gilliam']

Dictionaries
============

example::

    >>> person = {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M', 'status': 'Single'}

Tuples
======

Tuples can be used like lightweight dictionaries. Instead of having keys we use 
values in a certain order.

example::
    
    >>> person = ('Brian', 23, 'M', 'Single')

Sets
====

If you are familiar with sets and Venn diagrams then you will be familiar with
sets.
