Data Structures
***************

Data structures contain other objects. We will look at two: `lists`, `dictionaries`.

Typical methods defined on data structures are ones that allow access and
update items within it.

As always first we explore how to create objects using literals and
constructors, we then examine some methods typical of each object.

Second, we often want to do something for each item in a data structure. This
involves 'iterating' over it. We do this using the for loop.


Lists
=====

A list object contains ordered items.

creation:: 

    >>> ['John', 'Eric', 'Michael', 'Terry']          # literal
    >>> list(['John', 'Eric', 'Michael', 'Terry'])    # constructor
    >>> list('abc')                    # the list constructor can take a string
    ['a', 'b', 'c']                    # the result is a list of its characters
    >>> type([1, 2, 3])
    <class 'list'>

special syntax methods:: 

    >>> abc = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    >>> abc[0]                        # extract item
    'a'
    >>> abc[2] = 'd'                  # update item
    >>> abc
    ['a', 'b', 'd']


.. tip::
    Lists are 0 indexed. The first item is at index 0, the second at 1...

If you ask for an item that is outside of the list's length you will get an IndexError


range
-----

The `range` function combined with the `list` constructor is a fast way to create a list with a specified number of increasing integers::

    >>> list(range(3))   # think: give me numbers up to 3
    [0, 1, 2]

It provides a way of doing things a certain number of times.

::

    >>> for i in range(2):
    ...    print('hi') 
    'hi'
    'hi'


Dictionaries
============

Dictionaries contain key value mappings.

They can be used to collect information (data) about something. Here we use a dictinary to
represent a Person.

creation::

    >>> {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M'}              # literal
    >>> dict([('name', 'Brian'), ('age', 23), ('sex', 'M')])  # constructor

Special syntax for extracting and updating an attribute::

    >>> person = {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M'}
    >>> person['name']                          # extract value
    'Brian'
    >>> person['name'] = 'Naomi'                # update value
    >>> person['name']
    'Name'

If you request a non-existent key you get a `KeyError`.


Nesting 
=======

Data structures can include any type of object including other data structures.

Here is a list of dictionaries::

    >>> persons = [
            {'name': 'Naomi', 'age': 32, 'sex': 'F', 'status': 'Single'},
            {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 29, 'sex': 'F', 'status': 'Married'},
            {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M', 'status': 'Single'}
        ]

Think how this could be useful for example to store information about all
students in a class.

.. tip::
    Nested data structures are extremely common.


The `for` loop
==============

Use `for` to iterate over each item in a given list.

Here by iterate through a list of `str` objects we change the colour of our
turtle alex.

::

    from turtle import Turtle, exitonclick   

    alex = Turtle()

    for a_colour in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
       alex.color(a_colour)
       alex.forward(50)
       alex.left(90)

    exitonclick()


Refactoring `square`
--------------------

We refactor `square` combining `range` with a for loop.

::

    def square(side):
        for i in range(4):
            turtle.forward(side)
            turtle.left(90)

Drawing a square is reduced to repeating the same action four times. 

Thanks to the for loop our definition of a square in code:

* is shorter and more readable.
* communicates an insight into the geometry of a square.


Exercises
=========


Refactor `shapes.py`
--------------------

Refactor all the shapes in `shapes.py` and make good use of loops where you
can.

Hexagon
-------

Write code that draws this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-hexagon.png


Honeycomb
---------

Write code that draws this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-honeycomb.png


Any Shape
---------

Write code that draws this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-all-shapes.png

.. tip::

    The sum of the external angles of any shape is always 360 degrees.

Looping `turtles`
-----------------

Using the following as template draw this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-queue.png

`turtle_queue.py`::

    import turtle

    number_of_turtles = 4

    turtles = []
    for _ in range(number_of_turtles):
        turtles.append(turtle.Turtle())

    # position point of origin at bottom left of window
    turtle.setworldcoordinates(0, 0, 600, 600)

    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        turtle_.up()

    # Evenly space out the turtles
    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        ypos = 600 / number_of_turtles * i
        turtle_.setpos(0, ypos)

    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        turtle_.down()
