Data Structures
***************

Data structures or collections contain other objects. 

We will look at two: `lists`, `dictionaries`.

The methods that interest us are accessing and updating items within the collections. 

Collections go hand in hand with iteration. Often we want to do something for each
member in a data structure. 

As always first we explore how to create objects using literals and
constructors, we then examine some methods typical of each object.

Then we introduce the for loop which enables easy iteration over any data
structure.

Lists
=====

Lists are container objects. A list object contains ordered items.

creation:: 

    >>> ['John', 'Eric', 'Michael', 'Terry']          # literal
    >>> list(['John', 'Eric', 'Michael', 'Terry'])    # constructor
    >>> list('abc')                    # the list constructor can take a string
    ['a', 'b', 'c']                    # the result is a list of its characters
    >>> type([1, 2, 3])
    <class 'list'>

special syntax methods:: 

    >>> abc = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    >>> abc[0]                        # extract item
    'a'
    >>> abc[2] = 'd'                  # update item
    >>> abc
    ['a', 'b', 'd']


.. tip::
    Lists are 0 indexed. The first item is at index 0, the second at 1...

If you ask for an item that is outside of the list's length you will get an IndexError

range
-----

The `range` function combined with the `list` constructor is a shortcut way to create a list with a specified number of increasing integers::

    >>> list(range(3))   # think: give me numbers up to 3
    [0, 1, 2]

It provides a handy way of doing things a certain number of times.

::

    >>> for i in range(2):
    ...    print('hi') 
    'hi'
    'hi'


Dictionaries
============

Dictionaries contain key value mappings.

They can be used to collect information (data) about something. Here we use a dictinary to
represent a Person.

creation::

    >>> {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M'}              # literal
    >>> dict([('name', 'Brian'), ('age', 23), ('sex', 'M')])  # constructor

Special syntax for extracting and updating an attribute::

    >>> person = {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M'}
    >>> person['name']                          # extract value
    'Brian'
    >>> person['name'] = 'Naomi'                # update value
    >>> person['name']
    'Name'

If you request a non-existent key you get a `KeyError`.

Nesting Data Structures
=======================

Data structures can include any type of object including other data structures.

Here is a list of dictionaries::

    >>> persons = [
            {'name': 'Naomi', 'age': 32, 'sex': 'F', 'status': 'Single'},
            {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 29, 'sex': 'F', 'status': 'Married'},
            {'name': 'Brian', 'age': 23, 'sex': 'M', 'status': 'Single'}
        ]

.. tip::
    Nested data structures are extremely common.


for loops
=========

Use `for` to iterate over each item in a given list.

Here by iterate through a list of `str` objects we change the colour of our
turtle alex.

::

    from turtle import Turtle, exitonclick   

    alex = Turtle()

    for a_colour in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
       alex.color(a_colour)
       alex.forward(50)
       alex.left(90)

    exitonclick()

.. tip::
    Loops are flow control statements which work hand in hand with data structures. 


Refactoring `square`
--------------------

We refactor `square` combining `range` with a for loop.

::

    def square(side):
        for i in range(4):
            turtle.forward(side)
            turtle.left(90)

Drawing a square is reduced to repeating the same action four times. 

Thanks to the for loop our definition of a square in code:
* is shorter and more readable.
* communicates an insight into the geometry of a square.

Looping `turtles`
-----------------

Using the following as template draw this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-queue.png

`turtle_queue.py`::

    import turtle

    number_of_turtles = 4

    turtles = []
    for _ in range(number_of_turtles):
        turtles.append(turtle.Turtle())

    # position point of origin at bottom left of window
    turtle.setworldcoordinates(0, 0, 600, 600)

    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        turtle_.up()

    # Evenly space out the turtles
    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        ypos = 600 / number_of_turtles * i
        turtle_.setpos(0, ypos)

    for i, turtle_ in enumerate(turtles):
        turtle_.down()

Refactor `shapes.py`
--------------------

Refactor all the shapes in `shapes.py` and make good use of loops where you
can.

Hexagon
-------

Write code that draws this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-hexagon.png


Honeycomb
---------

Write code that draws this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-honeycomb.png


Any Shape
---------

Write code that draws this:

.. image:: /images/turtle-all-shapes.png

.. tip::

    The sum of the external angles of any shape is always 360 degrees.
